<LessonDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  **POLP** (also known as "Principle of Least Privilege") states components of a 
  system should be designed to function with the least privilege, access, and exposure. 
  This makes the overall system stronger from a security standpoint. A compromise 
  or failure of 1 piece has a minimized impact on the rest of the system. Other 
  benefits include avoiding naming collisions, unexpected behavior, and unintended 
  dependencies. For each piece, default to exposing the minimum. Keep everything 
  else private. **A scope enables control of a declaration's exposure**.

  ## 1. Levels

  In JavaScript, scopes are determined at compile time. This is known as **lexical 
  scope**. Each scope can only access declaration within itself or in parent scopes. 
  However, during compliation, declarations may move to a different scope. 
  
  There are 4 levels of scope:

  <CodePreview
    sandboxId={frontmatter.sandboxId}
    previewHeight={frontmatter.previewHeight}
  />

  <div class="table-container">
  | **Scope**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
  | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Global        | If a .js file is being imported into a .html file, its outer most scope is the global scope. Although the function arguments are highlighted, they aren't included in the global scope. Details below.                                  |
  | Module        | If the HTML tag importing the .js file has the module type attribute, <script type="module" src="index.js"></script>, its outer most scope is no longer the global scope, but a module scope.                                           |
  | Function      | Both function and block scopes can be identified by looking where {} brackets start and end.                                                                                                                                            |
  | Block         | Following POLP, tmp should be as hidden in scope as possible. Therefore, it is blocked scoped in an if statement. You could remove if (x > y) above & still have a block scope. Note: a switch statement does not define a block scope. |

  ## 2. Arguments

  Function and block scopes are between the `{}` brackets, which means a function's 
  arguments aren't within a function's scope. They aren't in a function's parent 
  scope either. When compiled, the location of arguments can be thought of as being 
  in a new scope that wraps the function.

  Let's see **two different examples** (1 and 2) before and after compile:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  example1.js
  -----------
  // Before compile:

  function myFunc(input) {
   return input
  }

  myFunc(1)
  

  // After compile:

  {
    var input = 1

    function myFunc() {
      return input
    }
  }

  myFunc(1)
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  example2.js
  -----------
  // Before compile:

  const myArray = [...]

  for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  ...
  }
  ...
  

  // After compile:

  const myArray = [...]

  {
    let i = 0

    for (; i < myArray.length; i++) {
      ...
    }
  }

  ...
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  This is why `const` can't be used in a `for` loop. It needs to be re-assigned 
  after the 1st iteration via `i++`.

  ---

  ## 3. Accessing Variables and functions

  When a reference cannot be found within a scope, the parent scope is searched. If 
  it still can't be found, the next parent scope is searched. This continues until 
  the reference is found or there are no more scopes to search. At that point, a 
  reference error will be thrown. Below is an example of a variable that is declared 
  in the global scope but accessed from a function scope. The engine 1st searches the 
  function scope for `myVar`. It can't find it, so it then searches the parent scope 
  and finds the declaration.

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------

  const myVar = 1

  function myFunc() {
  console.log(myVar)
  }

  myFunc()

  /* Although it might seem 
  obvious, the result displayed 
  in the console is:
  1
  The engine indeed found the 
  parent scope declaration. */ 
  ```
  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ---

  ## 4. Global Scope

  The global scope is where:

  ▪ JavaScript exposes:

    ```text
    - Primitives
    - Natives
    - Global functions: eval(), parseInt(), ...
    - Namespaces: Math, JSON
    - Intl, WebAssembly
    ```

  ▪ The environment hosting the JS engine exposes its own built-ins:

    ```text
    - console
    - The DOM (window, document, ...)
    - Timers (setTimeout(..), etc.)
    - Web platform APIs: navigator, history, geolocation, WebRTC, etc.
    ```

  If the environment is the browser, a `var` or `function` declaration in the global scope 
  will be added to the global object. This object is commonly accessed through `window`. 
  However, it is better to use the standardized reference `globalThis` instead:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  example1.js
  -----------
  function canMakeHTTPRequest() {
    return typeof globalThis.XMLHttpRequest === 'function';
  }

  console.log(canMakeHTTPRequest());

  // Expected output (in a browser): true
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  example2.js
  -----------
  globalThis.myGlobalVar = "Hello, World!";

  function greet() {
      console.log(globalThis.myGlobalVar);
  }

  greet(); 
  
  /* Outputs "Hello, World!" in any environment.
  globalThis ensures that it's accessible no 
  matter where the code runs. */ 
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ### IIFE

  An application could include many global variables and functions from different source 
  files. Limiting the number of these prevents problems like name collisions. One way to do 
  this is to use an **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**. Commonly used for 
  initiating code (code that runs as soon as the JavaScript loads), it is a function that:

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ is invoked as soon as it is defined,

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ doesn't pollute the global namespace, and 

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ can't be invoked again.

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  example1.js
  -----------
  (function () {
    // …
  })();

  (() => {
    // …
  })();

  (async () => {
    // …
  })();
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  example2.js
  -----------

  // Executing an async function:

  const getFileStream = async (url) => {
    // implementation
  };

  (async () => {
    const stream = await getFileStream("https://domain.name/path/file.ext");
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
      console.log({ chunk });
    }
  })();
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ## 5. Documentation

  If you are still curious about more sophisticated uses of the module pattern and other uses 
  of IIFE, for instance, I would highly recommend the book 
  [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://patterns.addy.ie/) by Addy Osmani.
