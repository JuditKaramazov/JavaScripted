<LessonDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  We could say that JavaScript is a prototype-based language. The creation and behavior of objects 
  are based on prototypes that are objects themselves. Compared to other class-based languages, 
  JavaScript doesn’t have any class system and relies on objects. With the addition of classes in 
  JavaScript, it’s now possible to use more traditional class creation and inheritance. Classes are 
  templates for objects. You assemble a single template which is used to create various objects.

  ### new

  The `new` operator creates an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in 
  object types that have a constructor function. When a function is invoked with `new` in front 
  of it, we call it a constructor call. It will:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ create a new object,

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ the object is `[[Prototype]]`-linked to the function,

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ the returned object is set as the `this` binding for that function call and

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ unless the function returns its own alternate object, the new-invoked function call will automatically return the newly constructed object.

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  class Point {
    constructor(x, y) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
    }

    static displayName = "Point";
    static distance(a, b) {
      const dx = a.x - b.x;
      const dy = a.y - b.y;

      return Math.hypot(dx, dy);
    }
  }

  const p1 = new Point(5, 5);
  const p2 = new Point(10, 10);
  p1.displayName; // undefined
  p1.distance; // undefined
  p2.displayName; // undefined
  p2.distance; // undefined

  console.log(Point.displayName); // "Point"
  console.log(Point.distance(p1, p2)); // 7.0710678118654755
  ```

  ## 1. Constructor

  The constructor method is a special field for initializing an object created with a class.

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  class MyClass {
    constructor(a) {
      this.a = a
    }
  }

  const myObj = new MyClass(1)

  console.log(myObj) // Output: { "a": 1 }
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  /* Remember that the behaviour of a class can be replicated using a 
   plain function: */

  function MyContructor(a) {
    this.a = a
  }

  // Creating an instance of MyContructor.
  const myObj = new MyContructor(1)

  // The prototype of "myObj" will be "MyContructor".
  console.log(myObj) // Output: { "a": 1 }
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ---

  ## 2. Extending

  Using the extend keyword, a class can extend another class. This removes the need to 
  rewrite functionality you want to use across multiple classes.

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  class Parent {
    constructor(a) {
      this.a = a
    }
  }

  class Child extends Parent {}

  const child = new Child(1)
  console.log(child.a)
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  /* If the child uses a contructor method, the super keyword
   needs to be called before this can be used. 
   It will invoke the parent's contructor method. */

  class Parent {
    constructor(a) {
      this.a = a
    }
  }

  class Child extends Parent {
    constructor(a, b) {
    super(a)
    this.b = b
    }
  }

  const child = new Child(1, 2)
  console.log(child.a) // 1
  console.log(child.b) // 2
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ---

  ## 3. Public and Private

  Fields are public by default. Prefixing a field with a `#` will make them private. 
  Private fields can only be accessed within the class:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  class MyClass {
    publicField = 1
    #privateField = 2

    logPrivateField() {
    console.log(this.#privateField)
    }
  }

  const myClass = new MyClass()

  console.log(myClass.publicField) // 1
  console.log(myClass.privateField) // undefined
  myClass.logPrivateField() // 2

  // Remember something crucial, though:
  // The constructor field cannot be private.
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ## 4. Documentation 

  As usual, don't forget to check [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) 
  in order to get a better understanding of classes, as well as many other JavaScript aspects.
