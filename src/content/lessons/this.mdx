<LessonDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  The "this" keyword refers to the context where a piece of code, such as a function's 
  body, is supposed to run. Most typically, it is used in object methods, where "this" 
  refers to the object the method is attached to, thus allowing the same method to be reused 
  on different objects. 

  The value of "this" in JavaScript depends on how a function is invoked (runtime binding), 
  not how it is defined.

  ## 1. Introduction 

  When a function is invoked, it creates an execution context containing:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ where the function was called (the call-stack),

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ how the function was called,

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ what parameters were passed,

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ the `this` reference. `this` is a keyword representing a binding.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ ...

  Below, you will see that `func` is called in the global scope. When that is executed, `this` 
  becomes a bound to the global object. When `this.a = 1` is executed, it will result in 
  `globalThis.a = 1`. 

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  function func() {
    this.a = 1;
  }

  func();

  console.log(func.a)
  console.log(globalThis.a)

  // Output: 
  // undefined 
  // 1
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  /* 
  If the intention was to add an a property to the func object, .call(..) could be used. 
  It calls a function and defines what this is bound to.
  */

  function func() {
   this.a = 1;
  }

  func.call(func);

  console.log(func.a)
  console.log(globalThis.a)

  // Output: 
  // 1 
  // undefined
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ---

  ## 2. Call-Site

  If you need to find what this is bound to at some point in your code, you 1st need to find the 
  <span class="font-bold">call-site</span>: this is, the location where a function is called. It can be determined by looking at 
  the [call-stack](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-call-stack/), a structure that records 
  the current position of an executable script.

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  function func3() {
   // Call-stack = main -> func1 -> func2 -> func3
   // Call-site = func2
  }

  function func2() {
  // Call-stack = main -> func1 -> func2
  // Call-site = func1

  func3();
  }

  function func1() {
  // Call-stack = main -> func1
  // Call-site = main

  func2();
  }

  // Call-stack = main

  func1();
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  <span class="font-bold">Note</span>: Remember that the call-stack can be viewed in the browser dev tools. Set a breakpoint and refresh 
  the page; the debugger will pause at this exact line. Then, it will display the current <span class="font-bold">call-stack</span>. The 
  second item from the top will be the <span class="font-bold">call-site</span>.

  ---

  ## 3. Rules 

  Base on the call-site, ask these questions in order. Stop when the first rule applies:

  ### I. Is the function called with a "new" binding? 

  When a function is invoked with `new` in front of it (a constructor call):

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  // Example of "new" binding.

  function func(a) {
    this.a = a;
  }

  const myVar = new func(1);
  console.log(myVar.a) 

  // Output: 1

  /* 
  Steps:
  1st, a new object is created.
  2nd, the object is [[Prototype]]-linked.
  3rd, the object is set as the "this" binding 
  for that function call.
  4th, the new-invoked function call will automatically 
  return the newly constructed object. 
  */
  
  // Exception:
  // If the function returns its own alternate object.
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ### II. Has "bind(..)" been used? 

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  // Example of "bind" usage.

    function func1() {
    console.log(this.a);
  }

  const obj = {
  a: 1
  };

  const func2 = func1.bind(obj)
  func2()

  // Output: 1

  // Explanation: 
  // bind(..) returns a new function that is hard-coded to call 
  // the original function with the specified "this".
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ### III. Are "call(..)" or "apply(..)" used? 

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  // Example of "call" usage.

  function func() {
    console.log(this.a);
  }

  const obj = {
  a: 1
  };

  func.call(obj);

  // Output: 1

  /* 
  Explanation: 
  call(..) invokes a function and defines what "this" should be 
  a bound to. 
  apply(..) would have the same result. 
  */
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>


  ### IV. Does the call-site have a context object? 

  `this` is the already-mentioned context object. Considering that:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  /* 
  Example of call-site using obj's context 
  to reference the function. 
  */

  function func() {
    console.log(this.a);
  }

  const obj = {
  a: 1,
  func
  };

  obj.func();

  // Output: 1

  /* 
  Explanation: 
  At the point that func is called, it's preceded 
  by an object reference to obj. 
  */ 
  ```
  
  </StaticCodeContainer>

  What we just saw is common when using browser API functions like `setTimeout(() => { .. }, 1000)`. 
  Here, `setTimeout` is actually `window.setTimeout`. Therefore, `this` within the anonymous function 
  is `window`.

  ### V. "undefined" in strict mode, global object otherwise 

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  // The catch-all rule when none of the other rules apply.

  function func() {
    console.log(this.a);
  }

  // A var declared in the global scope will set  
  // a property on the global object:
  var a = 1;

  func();

  // Output: 1

  // Explanation: 
  // When func is called, this is bound to the global object.
  ```
  
  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ---

  ## 4. No Bridge Allowed

  Make no mistake: `this` does not refer to a function's scope. Let's analyze an example. 

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  function func1() {
    const a = 1;
    this.func2();
  }

  function func2() {
  console.log(this.a);
  }

  func1();

  // Output: undefined

  /* 
  Explanation: 
  The above code is attempting to use "this" to create 
  a bridge between the scopes of func1 and func2, 
  so that func2 can access a. 
  */
  ```
  
  </StaticCodeContainer>

  <span class="font-bold">No such bridge is possible</span>. You can't use a `this` reference to look something up in a scope. 

  No wormholes here either, I'm afraid.

  ---

  ## 5. Arrow Functions 

  Instead of the 4 standard binding rules, an arrow-function, `() => { .. }` will adopt the `this` binding 
  from its enclosing function call. Set when the function is created, not to the environment in which the 
  function is called.

  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding-top: 1rem;">
    <img src="img/lesson/_arrow-function.svg" alt="Arrow function visual example." width="270px" height="auto" align-items="center" />
  </div>

  As an example: 

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  const obj = {
    a: 1,
    func1() {
        console.log(this.a);
    },
    func2: () => {
        // As we are in an arrow function, 'this' = func2.
        // Setting func2.a = 2
        a = 2
        console.log(this.a);
        // Therefore, this.a = 2 (irrelevant where func2 gets called)
    }
  };

  // 'this' is set.
  obj.func1()
  obj.func2()

  // Output:
  // 1
  // 2
  ```
  
  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ---

  ## 6. Documentation 

  There are some great explanations out there that I would definitely recommend, such as: 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-this-keyword-in-javascript/), or 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ [You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/README.md)

  Remember, however, that these notes need to work <span class="font-bold">for you</span>, no matter what others say!
