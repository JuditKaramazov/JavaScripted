<LessonDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  A variable is a "named storage" for data. Whenever there's a need to store a 
  piece of data, variables contain it, making it possible to use such data in the 
  program elsewhere. Using variables also ensures code re-usability since it can 
  be used to replace the same value in multiple places. 
  In plain words, they are symbolic names for values in our application, no matter 
  if their stocked information might change over time.

  ## 1. Introduction 

  A variable is a <span class="font-bold">binding</span> between a name and a value. A variable is:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ <span class="font-bold">declared</span> when a `const`, `let` or `var` keyword is used with a name: `let myVar`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ <span class="font-bold">initialized</span> when an initial value is assigned to it: `myVar = 1`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ <span class="font-bold">reassigned</span> when its value changes: `myVar = 2`

  Although you can declare and initialize a variable on the same line of code: 
  `let myVar = 1`, the engine will declare and initialize it in 2 different steps.

  ## 2. Primitive vs Object Binding

  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

  </div>

  <span class="font-bold">Metaphor time:</span>

  Remember the old arcade era? Did you ever play consoles such as NES or old home computers 
  like Atari? 
  Whatever the case, imagine that you have a NES at home where you can play <span class="font-bold">Donkey Kong</span>. 
  You are the owner of the console, the game belongs to you, and you set your own high score. 
  Independently of the time it takes you to play again, your high score remains there. 

  However, imagine there is also an arcade place nearby home. You do know the address, but 
  nothing there belongs to you. You visit such an amazing space, play <span class="font-bold">Donkey Kong</span>, and get 
  the high score. Some days later, however, your name doesn't appear anymore, as several 
  other players beat your marks. 

  A <span class="font-bold">primitive binding</span> is similar to owning your own copy of <span class="font-bold">Donkey Kong</span> at home, which 
  means that only you can set the high score. An <span class="font-bold">object binding</span>, however, is the arcade machine: 
  you don't own it, and you only know the address of the place. Although you can set a high score, 
  so can others.

  Now, let's remember that <span class="font-bold">JavaScript has 8 types</span>:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ `null`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ `undefined`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ `boolean`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ `string`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ `number`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ `bigint`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ `symbol`

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ `object`

  All of them are primitives except for `object`. 

  <div class="table-container">
  | Example       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                              |
  | ------------  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | <span class="font-bold">Primitive</span> | When you assign a <span class="font-bold">primitive</span> to a variable, `let myVar = 1`, the value `1` is bound to the name `myVar`.                                                                              |
  | <span class="font-bold">Object</span>    | When you assign an <span class="font-bold">object</span> to a variable, `let myVar = { a: 1 }`, the value isn't bound to myVar. Instead, an object reference is bound to `myVar`. The memory address of `{ a: 1 }`. |
  </div>

  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="img/lesson/_object-reference.svg" alt="Example of object reference." width="500px" height="auto" align-items="center" />
  </div>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ <span class="font-bold">Example 1</span>. When assigning or passing variables of a primitive, a copy 
  of the value is created.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ <span class="font-bold">Example 2</span>. When assigning or passing variables of an object, a copy of 
  the reference is created. If 2 variables are assigned the same object, changing the value of one will 
  change the other:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  example1.js
  -----------
  // Primitive binding.

  var var1 = 1
  var var2 = var1
  var var3 = var1

  var2++
  console.log(var3)

  // Output: 1
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  example2.js
  -----------
  // Object binding.

  var var1 = { a: 1 }
  var var2 = var1
  var var3 = var1

  var2.a++
  console.log(var3)

  // Output: { a: 1 }
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  <span class="font-bold">Note</span>: When comparing objects using the equality opertor, `===`, the results can be unintuitive. 
  See [Referential Equality](/reference) for details.

  ## 3. Redeclaring 
  
  Do you remember our dear [scopes](/scopes)? Taking this into account, you can redeclare a variable 
  declared with `var` statement in the same scope or inner-outer scopes, as these variables are <span class="font-bold">global</span>.

  However, when it comes to the variables declared with `let` and `const`, you can't redeclare these statements 
  in the same scope - but you can do so in inner scopes, as variables with `let` and `const` are <span class="font-bold">block scope</span>:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  // Redeclaration with var.
  
  var pepper = "üå∂Ô∏è";

  console.log(pepper); // üå∂Ô∏è

  // Inner Scope,
  {
    var pepper = "ü•¶";

    console.log(pepper); // ü•¶
  }

  console.log(pepper); // ü•¶
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  // Redeclaration with let.

  let eggplant = "üçÜ";

  let eggplant = "ü•î"; 
  
  // Output: SyntaxError
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  /* 
  Redeclaration in inner scopes, as let and const are
  block scope and don't affect the outer scopes. 
  */

  const carrot = "ü•ï";

  // Block Scope.
  {
    const carrot = "üçí";

    console.log(carrot); // üçí
  }

  console.log(carrot); // ü•ï
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ## 4. undefined vs undeclared

  `undefined` is the default value of a variable or property. If we simply write `let myVar` and then 
  `console.log(myVar)`, that's the result we will have. 

  Considering this, attempting to access a variable that hasn't been declared throws a <span class="font-bold">reference error</span>. 
  Although the error states `myVar` is not defined, a more accurate description is `myVar` is <span class="font-bold">undeclared</span>.

  ## 5. Documentation

  Don't hesitate to visit the following sections to get more information about types, variables, and scopes: 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ [JavaScripted: Types](/types) 

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚ñ™ [JavaScripted: Scopes](/scopes) 

  Also, keep in mind that [The Modern JavaScript site](https://javascript.info/variables) has plenty of examples 
  you might find useful when getting started with the fundamentals.
