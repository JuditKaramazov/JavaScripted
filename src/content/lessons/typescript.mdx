<LessonDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  Getting going with TypeScript isn't as straightforward as it seems. There's tooling 
  to configure, and the type system requires a different way of thinking about variables 
  and functions than you used in JavaScript. Concepts like generics, mapped types, and 
  type guards might be confusing, and the TypeScript compiler can (and <span class="font-bold">will</span>) be unforgiving 
  when it comes to type errors.

  But that's the exact beauty of it.

  ## 1. Introduction 

  This will probably be my shortest entry when it comes to this collection of JavaScript 
  notes I decided to share. However, and just as stated before, yes: there are certain 
  TypeScript concepts and features you'll have to interiorize, but don't forget where you 
  come from: 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ basic autocompletion, 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ limited refactoring support, 
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ and the constant fear of runtime errors. 

  JavaScript's flexibility is a <span class="font-bold">double-edged sword</span>. While it allows you to quickly write code that 
  works, it also leaves you open to runtime errors and subtle bugs that can be tricky to track down. 

  ## 2. Advantages 

  TypeScript provides the following advantages (and quite more) over vanilla JavaScript:

  <div class="table-container">
  | <span class="font-bold">TypeScript</span>  | Advantages                                                          |
  | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------  |
  |                 | Self-documentation.                                                 |
  |                 | Tooling that improves developer experience (e.g., IntelliSense).    |
  |                 | Eliminates runtime bugs through static analysis.                    |
  |                 | Facilitates easier refactoring with type safety.                    |
  |                 | Better collaboration through clear type contracts.                  |
  </div>

  Making types clear directs our attention to the details of our system's construction and the interactions 
  between its many components. In addition, <span class="font-bold">types invalidate many trivial errors</span> that may creep into JavaScript 
  codebases - and <span class="font-bold">provide a rapid feedback loop</span> for correcting all the minor problems that occur while writing 
  new code or refactoring.

  However, although this might sound overwhelming, JavaScript and TypeScript <span class="font-bold">are not so different</span> at all.

  ## 3. Stop reading and go TypeScripted

  TypeScript wasn't invented to make JavaScript strongly typed: it was built to <span class="font-bold">allow amazing tooling</span> for 
  JavaScript.

  Let's imagine JavaScript, but with static type features added. If we remove all of the types from TypeScript code, 
  what's left should be valid JavaScript code. The formal word used in the TypeScript documentation is "type-level extension": 
  most TypeScript features are <span class="font-bold">type-level extensions</span> to JavaScript, and they don't affect the code's runtime behavior:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```ts
  index.ts 
  --------
  // TypeScript example.

  function add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
  }
  add(1, 2); // Evaluates to 3.

  // Here, we see a type-level extension example, 
  // written in TypeScript.
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  // JavaScript example. 

  function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  }
  add(1, 2); // Evaluates to 3.

  /* 
  The compiler checks the code's types to generate 
  JavaScript code. By removing the type annotations, 
  what we have is perfectly legal JavaScript code. 
  */
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  In the beginning, TypeScript was unthinkable for me - until I saw an example similar to this one. We can't reduce 
  TypeScript to this specific example, as you'll encounter both <span class="font-bold">differences and similarities</span> between it and JavaScript. 

  Embrace this example if you don't feel confident enough, though - and keep building from it.

  Now, allow me to repeat myself: <span class="font-bold">go TypeScript yourself</span>. I am serious.

  Stop reading me.

  Close this window. 

  Don't be scared.
  
  It'll be fine.

  TypeScript your limits.
