<LessonDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  Hoisting is the default behavior in JavaScript where variable and function 
  declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the 
  compilation phase (aka before executing the code). This guarantees that 
  regardless of where these declarations appear within a scope, they can be 
  accessed throughout that scope, aiding in more flexible coding practices and 
  avoiding “undefined” errors during execution.

  ## 1. Introduction

  **Note**: If you are unfamiliar with the terminology below, check out:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ [JavaScript Variables](/variables)

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ [JavaScript Scopes](/scopes)

  An **identifier** is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a `variable`, 
  `function`, or `property`. Let's see an example: the `myVar` string in `var myVar = 1`. 
  Every time the compiler enters a scope, it starts registering declarations. Each 
  identifier will be moved to the top of a scope. This is known as `hoisting`. What scope 
  the identifier moves to the top of depends on the type of declaration:
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ `function`,
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ `var` or
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ `let`, `const` and `class`.

  </div>

  **Metaphor time:**

  Imagine you're working in a messy library. Books are literally everywhere and you can put them wherever 
  you want. However, when a real professional joins the team, they move everything and place narrative books 
  on a certain shelf, poetry ones on a different one, and so on.

  Your messy (and clearly unprofessional) library is the scope, all kinds of books are identifiers, 
  and the **real** professional is the compiler. While coding, we can put identifiers wherever we want in the 
  scope, but when the compiler enters the scope, it moves them to their right place.

  That's hoisting.

  ---

  ## 2. function

  A `function`-declared identifier will move to the top of the nearest `block scope`. If none is available, 
  the nearest parent scope. It will also be initialized to its associated function reference and can 
  be used. Below is an example of calling a function before it is declared. It works because it is 
  hoisted to the top of the global scope by the compiler before `line: 1` is executed.

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  hoisted(); // Output: "This function has been hoisted."

  function hoisted() {
    console.log('This function has been hoisted.');
  };

  /* 
  Now, we can see why JavaScript enables us to 
  invoke a function seemingly before declaring it. 
  */
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  index.js
  -------- 
  /* 
  However, function expressions are not 
  hoisted: 
  */

  expression(); // Output: "TypeError: expression is not a function"

  var expression = function() {
    console.log('Will this work?');
  };
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  Given the examples, remember that hoisting completely to the top only applies to formal functions 
  (functions declared with the function keyword), not function expressions like:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ `const func = () => { .. }` or

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ `const func = function() { .. }`

  ---

  ## 3. var 

  A `var`-declared identifier will move the top of the nearest **function scope**. If none is available, then global 
  or module scope. It will also be initialized to its default value of `undefined` and can be used. Even if you declare 
  and initialize the variable on the same line, `var myVar = 1`, only the identifier is hoisted. The variable will be 
  initialized to its correct value when the line of code is executed.

    <img src="img/lesson/_var-hoisting.svg" alt="Examples of var hoisting." width="600px" height="auto" align-items="center" />
  </div>

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  --------
  console.log(myVar)
  var myVar = 1;
  console.log(myVar) 

  // Output: undefined
  // 1
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  index.js
  -------- 
  /* 
  Below is an example of a variable declared 
  and initialized in a block scope. Because it's 
  declared as a var, it is hoisted to the 
  function scope: 
  */

  function myFunc(x) {
    if (x === 1) {
        var y = 1
    }

  console.log(y)
  }

  myFunc(1)

  // Output: 1
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ## 4. const, let and class

  A `const`, `let` or `class`-declared identifier will move the top of the nearest **block scope**. If none 
  available, the nearest parent scope. It will also be initialized to its default value of `uninitialized`. 
  It will remain uninitialized until the compiler executes the line where is it declared. Attempting to 
  use it before then results in an error.

  That's closely related to TDZ, as we'll see below.

  ### TDZ

  If we attempt to write:

  ```js
  console.log(myVar) 
  let myVar = 1;
  ```

  we'll receive the following error: **"Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myVar' before initialization"**. 
  Why is that happening?

  The above is an example of **The Temporal Dead Zone**. A window of time where a variable is declared but uninitialized. 
  When a `var` is hoisted, it is initialized with a default value of `undefined`, so it has a TDZ of 0 in length and 
  unobservable. `let`, `const` and `class` have an observable TDZ:

  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <img src="img/lesson/_tdz-example.svg" alt="Examples of TDZ." width="500px" height="auto" align-items="center" />
  </div>

  TDZ errors can be avoided by always putting `let`, `const` and `class` declarations at the top of their scope. This 
  shrinks the TDZ to 0 length. If the declaration isn't needed from the beginning, create an inner block scope: 

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  badexample.js
  -------------
  // Don't do this:

    function add1IfEven(x) {
    if (!x) {
        throw new Error("Input required")
    }

    const isEven = x%2 === 0
    return isEven ? x + 1 : x
  }
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  goodexample.js
  --------------
  // Instead, do this:

  function add1IfEven(x) {
    if (!x) {
      throw new Error("Input required")
    }

    {
      const isEven = x%2 === 0
      return isEven ? x + 1 : x
    }
  }
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  Also, keep in mind that **rules of scope**, such as **hoisting**, are applied per scope instance. During execution, 
  each time a scope is entered, everything resets. This is why using a `const` within a loop doesn't throw an already 
  declared error after the 1st iteration.
