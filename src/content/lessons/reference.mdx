<LessonDescription name={frontmatter.name}>
  In JavaScript, all values that are not primitive (string, number, boolean, bigint, 
  symbol, null, or undefined) are objects. This includes arrays, functions, and 
  regular expressions. You need to be aware of referential equality when comparing 
  objects. In plain words, referential equality determines whether the two provided 
  operands refer to the same reference/object instance. The variables are considered 
  referentially equal when compared because they reference the same object.

  ## 1. Understanding Referential Equality

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ **Example 1**: In the first code snippet below, the `operatingSystem` constant points to the 
  object with the `name` and `developer` properties. The `operatingSystem2` constant points to the same object as the 
  `operatingSystem` constant. It does not point to a copy.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;▪ **Example 2**: On the contrary, you may have two objects with the exact same shape, but because 
  they are separate objects in memory, they are not considered referentially equal. Let's think of identical 
  twins as a good example of this phenomenon: they may have the same DNA, but they are still two separate beings:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  example1.js
  -----------
  const operatingSystem = {
    name: "Windows",
    developer: "Microsoft",
  };

  const operatingSystem2 = operatingSystem;

  console.log(operatingSystem === operatingSystem2); // true
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  example2.js
  -----------
  const operatingSystem = {
    name: "Windows",
    developer: "Microsoft",
  };

  const operatingSystem2 = {
    name: "Windows",
    developer: "Microsoft",
  };

  console.log(operatingSystem === operatingSystem2); // false
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ### Primitives

  If you compare primitive types (`null`, `undefined`, `string`, `number`, `boolean` or `symbol`) using the 
  equality operator ===, the result is what you would expect:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  ----------
  const bool1 = true
  const bool2 = true
  console.log(bool1 === bool1)

  const num1 = 1
  const num2 = 1
  console.log(num1 === num2)

  const letter1 = "a"
  const letter2 = "a"
  console.log(letter1 === letter2)

  // Expected results:
  // true
  // true
  // true
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ### Objects

  However, if you compare objects object, array, function (array and function are a sub-class of object), the 
  result isn't as intuitive as one might think:

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  index.js
  ----------
  const person1 = {
    name: "Deckard"
  }
  const person2 = {
      name: "Deckard"
  }
  console.log(person1 === person2)

  const letters1 = ["a", "b"]
  const letters2 = ["a", "b"]
  console.log(letters1 === letters2)

  const function1 = () => null
  const function2 = () => null
  console.log(function1 === function2)

  // As warned previously, the results are:
  // false
  // false
  // false
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  `person1` and `person2` are both the same type: `object`. They have the same properties and values. It would 
  make sense if the equality operator returned true when comparing them. But it doesn't. This is because when 
  you compare objects, the operator is testing `reference equality`, not value equality. Testing whether they 
  are the same instance, not whether they are the same value. `person1` and `person2` may have the same value, 
  but they are **2 different object instances**. Thus, when compared using the equality operator, it returns 
  `false`.

  ## 2. Value vs Reference

  When assigning or passing variables of a primitive, a copy of the value is created. When assigning or passing 
  variables of an object, a copy of the reference is created.

  Let's see two examples: 

  <StaticCodeContainer>

  ```js
  example1.js
  -----------
  /* 
  'a' holds a copy of the value 2.
  'b' is assigned a copy of the value 2.
  Any changes to 'b' will not effect 'a'. 
  */

  var a = 2;
  var b = a;
  b++;
  console.log(a)

  // Therefore, the result is 2.
  ```

  ---

  ```js
  example2.js
  -----------
  /* 
  'c' holds a reference to the shared value '[1, 2, 3]'.
  'd' holds a copy of the reference to shared value '[1, 2, 3]'.
  When using the 'd' reference to modify the shared value, 'c' will be effected. 
  */
  
  var c = [1,2,3];
  var d = c;
  d.push(4);
  console.log(c);

  // In this case, the result is [1,2,3,4]
  ```

  </StaticCodeContainer>

  ## 3. Documentation

  If you'd want to know more about `types`, `grammar`, `values`, `coercion` or `natives`, don't hesitate to visit 
  the specific ["Types & Grammar" chapter from You don't know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/types%20%26%20grammar/ch2.md).
